#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Objective
The purpose of this project is determine the protein content from multiple grain cereals using near-infrared spectroscopy and machine learning/deep learning algorithms. Calibration models have been developed and will be deployed as rapid phenotyping tools for cereal breeders.

## Project Description
!["AI pipeline"](img/AI_pipeline.png)
* Measure protein content over 300 samples of peanut from wetlab analysis
* Scan the same samples using mobile and benchtop NIR sensors to record spectroscopic absorbance covering more than 1000 bands
* Preprocess the data (filtering, derivating, smoothing, etc)
* Develop ML/DL model architecture
* Train the model
* Make predictions
* Deploy the model


## Needs of this project

- frontend development for deployment
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/adamavip/fatty_acid_nirs_model/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](https://help.github.com/adamavip/fatty_acid_nirs_model/data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
